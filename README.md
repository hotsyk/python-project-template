# Minimal Python Project Template

A low dependency and really simple to start project template for Python Projects.

### HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

> **DO NOT FORK** this is meant to be used from **[Use this template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/generate)** feature.

1. Click on **[Use this template](https://github.com/rochacbruno/python-project-template/generate)**
3. Give a name to your project
   (e.g. `my_awesome_project` recommendation is to use all lowercase and underscores separation for repo names.)
3. Wait until the first run of CI finishes
   (Github Actions will process the template and commit to your new repo)

> **NOTE**: **WAIT** until first CI run on github actions before cloning your new project.
